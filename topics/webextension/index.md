A common approach to building browser extensions supported by multiple web browsers.

WebExtensions were first specified by the [Browser Extension Community Group](https://browserext.github.io/). This group produced a preliminary specification that described an browser extension platform that was closely modeled after Chrome's approach. Extensions written to this specification could potentially work on Chrome, Edge, Opera and Firefox.

Currently, extension developers are collaberating in the [WebExtension Community Group](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions) to increase compatibility across browsers and to specify a common extension platform.
